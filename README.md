# simpleGEC
A port of Andy Harris's simpleGE Python game engine to C++ using SDL as a graphics framework.

## Overview
This is a game engine designed to be simple to use for the beginner programmer who wants to delve into C++ game programming. It is made up of two primary classes: the Scene and the Sprite.

### The Scene
One of two primary classes in simpleGEC is the Scene class. It creates a window and renderer for you to create and draw to a window. It can be used as-is or subclassed for custom scenes.

### The Sprite
The other of the two primary classes is the Sprite class. This class allows you to use textures as well as bounding-rectangles to create sprites. It can also be subclassed for customization.
